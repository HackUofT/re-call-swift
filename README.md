# re-call
Leave your future self aggressive reminders so that you can get shit done later. An iOS app.

##use case

You've just had delicious poutine at U of T Hacks and you really need to go to the gym later. You create a reminder, record yourself saying "GO TO THE GYM YOU LAZY PERSON", and set the app to call you and play the recording on Monday, when you plan to go to the gym.
